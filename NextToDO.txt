🚀 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (High Impact, Low Effort)

1. Direct Messaging System 💬 ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT
Why it's #1:
•  Currently users can see profiles but can't communicate
•  Essential for actual community building and friendships
•  Huge gap in user experience right now
•  People need to coordinate logistics ("I'm running late")
•  Ice breaker before events reduces anxiety

What to build:
•  In-app messaging between users
•  Event-specific group chats (auto-created)
•  Real-time updates (Supabase Realtime)
•  Message notifications
•  Privacy settings (who can message you)

Impact: 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Without this, the platform feels incomplete



2. Notifications System 🔔 ⭐ CRITICAL
Why it's #2:
•  Users miss events they joined
•  No way to know about updates/changes
•  New followers/messages go unnoticed
•  Reduces engagement significantly

What to build:
•  Event reminders (24h before, 1h before)
•  New events from people you follow
•  Someone joined your event
•  New message/comment notifications
•  Event updates/changes
•  Bell icon in navbar with count

Impact: 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Dramatically increases engagement



3. Event Comments/Discussion 💭
Why it's #3:
•  People have questions before joining
•  Builds excitement and engagement
•  Clarifies details publicly
•  Shows community vibe

What to build:
•  Comment section on event pages
•  Host can pin important info
•  Notifications for comments
•  Delete/moderate capability

Impact: 🔥🔥🔥 Makes events feel more alive



✨ QUICK WINS (Do These First - 1-2 Days Each)

1. Event Cancellation Flow - Proper UI to cancel events and notify all attendees
2. "Similar Events" Section - Show related events based on interests/location
3. 404 Page - Branded, helpful 404 with links back to events
4. FAQ Page - Common questions about how the platform works
5. Terms of Service & Privacy Policy - Legal requirements before scaling
6. Event Update Notifications - Email/alert when host changes event details



📈 MY PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION:

Start with these 3 in order:

1. Notifications System (2-3 days)
◦  Build the infrastructure first
◦  Bell icon + notification list
◦  Database table for notifications
◦  Basic types: event reminders, follows, joins
2. Direct Messaging (4-5 days)
◦  1:1 chat only at first
◦  Simple message list + chat view
◦  Real-time with Supabase
◦  Notification integration
3. Event Comments (1-2 days)
◦  Simple comment section on event page
◦  Basic moderation (delete)
◦  Notification when someone comments

Total time: ~1.5-2 weeks for all three

Why this order?
•  Notifications infrastructure benefits messaging
•  Messaging is the most requested feature users will expect
•  Comments are quick and add immediate value



💡 ALTERNATIVE: If You Want Quick Dopamine Hits

Do all the "Quick Wins" first (1 week total):
•  Event cancellation
•  404 page
•  FAQ
•  Terms/Privacy
•  Similar events
•  Update notifications

These are easy, visible improvements that make the platform feel more polished.
