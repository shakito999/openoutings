# ‚úÖ Event Cancellation & Auto-Cleanup - Complete

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Event Cancellation System** üö´

#### For Hosts:
- **Cancel Button**: Red "–û—Ç–º–µ–Ω–∏ —Å—ä–±–∏—Ç–∏–µ" button visible only to event hosts
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Safety confirmation with warning about irreversibility
- **One-Click Cancel**: Simple process with automatic notification message

#### For Attendees:
- **Cancelled Badge**: Large, prominent red warning banner at top of cancelled events
- **Status Message**: Shows when the event was cancelled
- **Join Button Hidden**: Can't join cancelled events
- **Calendar Button Hidden**: No point adding cancelled events to calendar

#### UI Features:
- **Event List**: Cancelled events automatically hidden from main events page
- **Event Detail**: Clear "–°–™–ë–ò–¢–ò–ï–¢–û –ï –û–¢–ú–ï–ù–ï–ù–û" message
- **Dark Mode Support**: Full styling for both light and dark themes
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

---

### 2. **Automatic Event Cleanup** üóëÔ∏è

#### What Gets Deleted:
After **30 days** from event end/start date:
- ‚úÖ Event record from database
- ‚úÖ Event photos from Supabase storage
- ‚úÖ Event attendees list (cascade)
- ‚úÖ Event photo records (cascade)
- ‚úÖ QR codes (cascade)
- ‚úÖ Check-ins (cascade)
- ‚úÖ Reviews (cascade)
- ‚úÖ All related data

#### Why This Matters:
- **Cost Savings**: 94% reduction in storage costs
- **Database Performance**: Keeps database lean and fast
- **Privacy**: Old event data doesn't linger forever
- **Automatic**: Set it and forget it

## Database Changes

### New Columns in `events` table:
```sql
is_cancelled      boolean   DEFAULT false
cancelled_at      timestamptz
cancelled_by      uuid      REFERENCES profiles(id)
```

### New Functions:
- `cancel_event(event_id, user_id)` - Safely cancel an event with host verification
- `cleanup_old_events()` - Find and delete old events with photos

### New Index:
- Optimized filtering for non-cancelled events

---

## Files Created

### Components:
- `src/components/CancelEventButton.tsx` - Cancellation UI with confirmation

### Migrations:
- `supabase/migrations/20250118_event_cancellation_and_cleanup.sql` - Database schema

### Edge Functions:
- `supabase/functions/cleanup-old-events/index.ts` - Automated cleanup cron job

### Documentation:
- `CLEANUP_SETUP.md` - Complete setup instructions for cron job

---

## How It Works

### Cancellation Flow:
1. **Host** views their event ‚Üí clicks "–û—Ç–º–µ–Ω–∏ —Å—ä–±–∏—Ç–∏–µ" button
2. **Confirmation** dialog appears with warning
3. **Host** confirms ‚Üí database function verifies host identity
4. **Event** marked as `is_cancelled = true` with timestamp
5. **Page** refreshes showing cancellation banner
6. **Attendees** see cancelled status when they visit the page

### Cleanup Flow:
1. **Cron job** runs daily at 3 AM UTC (configurable)
2. **Edge Function** queries events older than 30 days
3. **Photos** deleted from Supabase storage bucket
4. **Events** deleted from database (cascade handles related data)
5. **Logs** record successful deletions

---

## Setup Required

### 1. Run the Migration
```bash
# Apply the database changes
# Run the SQL in: supabase/migrations/20250118_event_cancellation_and_cleanup.sql
```

### 2. Deploy Edge Function
```bash
npx supabase functions deploy cleanup-old-events
```

### 3. Set Up Cron Job
See `CLEANUP_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions. Options:
- **Supabase Cron** (recommended) - pg_cron extension
- **GitHub Actions** (free) - Runs on GitHub servers
- **Manual** - Run when needed

---

## Testing

### Test Cancellation:
1. Create a test event
2. View the event as the host
3. Scroll to the "–û—Ç–º–µ–Ω–∏ —Å—ä–±–∏—Ç–∏–µ" button in the sidebar
4. Click and confirm cancellation
5. ‚úÖ Page refreshes showing "–°–™–ë–ò–¢–ò–ï–¢–û –ï –û–¢–ú–ï–ù–ï–ù–û" banner
6. Visit events list ‚Üí cancelled event should not appear

### Test Cleanup (Manual):
```sql
-- Create a test old event
INSERT INTO events (title, host_id, starts_at, ends_at) 
VALUES ('Old Event', 'YOUR_USER_ID', NOW() - INTERVAL '31 days', NOW() - INTERVAL '31 days');

-- Run cleanup
SELECT cleanup_old_events();

-- Verify it's gone
SELECT * FROM events WHERE title = 'Old Event';
```

---

## Configuration

### Change Retention Period:
Edit these values to change from 30 days to something else:

**Migration file:**
```sql
WHERE ends_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '60 days'  -- Change to 60 days
```

**Edge Function:**
```typescript
thirtyDaysAgo.setDate(thirtyDaysAgo.getDate() - 60);  // Change to 60
```

---

## Cost Impact

### Example Calculation:
- 100 events/month
- 3 photos per event (2MB each)
- Supabase storage: $0.021/GB/month

**Before:**
- 1 year = 7.2GB = $0.15/month (growing)

**After (30-day cleanup):**
- Maximum 600MB = $0.01/month (stable)

**Savings: $1.68/year per 100 events**

---

## Security

- ‚úÖ Only event hosts can cancel their events
- ‚úÖ Database function enforces host verification
- ‚úÖ Edge Function uses service role key (secure)
- ‚úÖ No data recovery after deletion (by design)
- ‚úÖ Cancellation is permanent and logged

---

## User Experience

### Before Cancellation:
- Event visible in listings
- Join button active
- Calendar button available
- QR check-in working

### After Cancellation:
- Event hidden from listings
- Large red warning banner
- Join button replaced with "cancelled" message
- Calendar button hidden
- QR check-in still visible for historical data

### After 30 Days:
- Event completely gone
- Photos deleted
- All related data removed
- Cannot be recovered

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- **Email notifications** when event is cancelled
- **Soft delete** option to keep event history
- **Export feature** before auto-deletion
- **Admin dashboard** to view/manage cancelled events
- **Cancellation reason** field for hosts
- **Bulk cancellation** for series of recurring events

---

## Troubleshooting

### Cancel button doesn't appear:
- Make sure you're the event host
- Check that event isn't already cancelled
- Verify you're logged in

### Cancelled events still show in listings:
- Clear your browser cache
- Check database: `SELECT is_cancelled FROM events WHERE id = X`
- Verify migration ran successfully

### Cleanup not running:
- Check Edge Function logs in Supabase dashboard
- Verify cron job is scheduled: `SELECT * FROM cron.job`
- Test manually: `SELECT cleanup_old_events()`
