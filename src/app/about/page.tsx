                Hey, I'm Shako. I'm 26, and I built this because I needed it myself.
              </p>

              <p>
                A year ago, I went through a breakup that hit me harder than I expected. Not just because I lost a relationship, but because I realized I'd lost my friends too. I'd been so wrapped up in that relationship that I'd become that friend who always cancels, who never shows up, who's always "busy." 
              </p>

              <p>
                You know what the worst part was? When I finally reached out to people, they'd moved on. New friend groups, new routines, new inside jokes I wasn't part of. And I got it - I'd done this to myself.
              </p>

              <div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-purple-50 dark:from-blue-900/20 dark:to-purple-900/20 rounded-xl p-6 border-l-4 border-blue-500">
                <p className="italic text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
                  "I spent three months going to work, coming home, ordering food, watching Netflix, and wondering why I felt so empty. I had everything I thought I wanted - good job, nice apartment, freedom - but I was lonely as hell."
                </p>
              </div>

              <p>
                So I decided to fix it. I'd always wanted to try hiking, but none of my old friends were into it. I thought: "I'll just go alone." 
              </p>

              <p>
                Except... I didn't. Because going alone felt weird. What if people thought I was a loser with no friends? What if something happened and I needed help? What if I just looked pathetic out there by myself?
              </p>

              <p>
                That's when it clicked. <span className="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">I wasn't the only one feeling this way.</span> There had to be other people in Sofia who wanted to do things but had no one to do them with. People who'd moved here for work. People who'd drifted from their friend groups. People who were just... lonely.
              </p>

                The Solution
              </h3>

              <p>
                I started building OpenOutings at 2 AM on a Tuesday. Couldn't sleep, couldn't stop thinking about it. What if there was a place where going alone wasn't weird - it was expected? Where everyone else was also there to meet people?
              </p>

              <p>
                <span className="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">No swiping. No small talk over coffee with a stranger from the internet. Just actual activities with actual people who share your actual interests.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                The first event I created was a hiking trip. Seven people showed up. All strangers to each other. All a little nervous. By the end of that hike, we had a group chat and plans for next weekend.
              </p>

              <div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-50 to-emerald-50 dark:from-green-900/20 dark:to-emerald-900/20 rounded-xl p-6 border-l-4 border-green-500">
                <p className="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-2">
                  Three months later:
                </p>
                <ul className="space-y-2 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
                  <li>‚Ä¢ I have a friend group again</li>
                  <li>‚Ä¢ I've tried things I never would have done alone (rock climbing, board game cafes, photography walks)</li>
                  <li>‚Ä¢ I actually look forward to weekends</li>
                  <li>‚Ä¢ I'm not lonely anymore</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

                Why This Works
              </h3>

              <p>
                Here's what I learned: <span className="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Friendships don't form from perfect profiles or clever bios. They form from shared experiences.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                When you're hiking a trail together, or figuring out a board game, or all trying the same weird coffee at a new cafe - that's when real connections happen. You're not performing for each other. You're just... being people. Doing things.
              </p>

              <p>
                And here's the secret: <span className="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">everyone at these events is in the same boat.</span> We're all there because we want to meet people. There's no shame in that. It's actually kind of beautiful.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">
                For You
              </h3>

              <p>
                If you're reading this and you're lonely - I get it. I've been there. I know how it feels to scroll through Instagram seeing everyone else having fun while you're home alone. Again.
              </p>

              <p>
                I built OpenOutings for you. For past me. For anyone who's ever thought "I wish I had someone to do this with."

              <p className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
                You don't need to have friends to join events. You need to join events to make friends.
              </p>

              <p>
                So pick an event. Any event. Show up. Be awkward if you need to - everyone else is a little awkward too. Say hi. Ask questions. Share experiences.
