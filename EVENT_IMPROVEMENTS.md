## 🔒 Storage Requirements

Make sure the `profiles` bucket has the `event-photos/` folder accessible with these policies:
- **Read**: Public (anyone can view event photos)
- **Insert**: Authenticated users only
- **Update**: Owner only
- **Delete**: Owner only

Run this if needed:
```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload event photos
INSERT INTO storage.policies (bucket_id, name, definition)
VALUES 
  ('profiles', 'Authenticated users can upload event photos', 'bucket_id = ''profiles'' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = ''event-photos'' AND auth.role() = ''authenticated''');

-- Allow public read access to event photos
INSERT INTO storage.policies (bucket_id, name, definition)
VALUES 
  ('profiles', 'Public read access to event photos', 'bucket_id = ''profiles'' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = ''event-photos''');
```
