## 🚀 Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
```
1. Create Poll → Generate slug
2. Create Poll Record → Store in DB
3. Generate Slots → Create (days × 4) slot records
4. Share Link → Copy/paste or direct visit
5. Vote → Anonymous user creation + vote storage
6. View Results → Aggregate votes and display
```

### Anonymous Voting System
- Creates temporary auth user per poll participant
- Stores in localStorage to prevent duplicate votes
- Links votes to user ID
- Allows updating votes (deletes old, inserts new)

### Vote States
- `1` = Available (✅)
- `0` = Maybe (unused in current UI)
- `-1` = Not Available (❌)

---

## 📋 Database Schema Used

### Tables
- `availability_polls`: Poll metadata
  - id, creator_id, title, starts_on, ends_on, slug
- `poll_slots`: Time slot options
  - id, poll_id, on_date, slot (enum)
- `poll_votes`: User responses
  - slot_id, user_id, preference (-1, 0, 1)

3. **No participant list**: Results don't show who voted
