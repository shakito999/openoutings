## üéØ What's Been Built

### 1. **QR Code Check-in System** ‚úÖ

#### For Event Hosts:
- **Generate QR Codes**: Hosts can create unique QR codes for their events from the event detail page
- **QR Management**: Show/hide QR codes, regenerate new codes, deactivate old ones
- **Verification**: Only active QR codes can be used for check-ins
- **Tracking**: See how many people have checked in

#### For Attendees:
- **Scan QR Codes**: Use device camera to scan host's QR code
- **Auto Check-in**: Automatic verification and check-in upon successful scan
- **Status Display**: See check-in status on event page
- **Mobile First**: Designed for mobile devices with cameras

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/EventQRCode.tsx` - QR generation and management
- `src/components/QRScanner.tsx` - Camera-based QR scanning
- `src/components/EventCheckIn.tsx` - Check-in status display
- `src/components/EventQRSection.tsx` - Client-side auth wrapper

**Database Tables:**
- `event_qr_codes` - Stores QR codes with expiration and tracking
- `event_checkins` - Records who checked in to which events

### 2. **Peer Review System** ‚≠ê

#### Review Features:
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Attendees review each other (not just hosts)
- **5-Star Rating System**: Overall rating with hover effects
- **Detailed Ratings**: Optional friendliness, communication, reliability scores
- **Review Text**: 10-1000 character requirement
- **Verified Badge**: Special badge for checked-in reviewers
- **48-Hour Edit Window**: Users can edit/delete reviews within 48 hours

#### Anti-Abuse Mechanisms:
- Can't review yourself
- One review per person per event
- Minimum character requirement prevents spam
- Auto-flagging of suspicious content (profanity detection)
- Community voting (helpful/not helpful)
- Manual flagging with reason submission
- IP hash tracking for spam detection
- Review moderation system ready

#### Review Display:
- **Profile Integration**: Reviews shown on user profiles
- **Statistics Summary**: Average rating, total reviews, star breakdown
- **Interactive**: Helpful/not helpful voting, flag inappropriate reviews
- **Event Context**: Shows which event the review is from
- **Verified Indicators**: Visual badges for verified attendees

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/ReviewForm.tsx` - Review submission with star ratings
- `src/components/ReviewsDisplay.tsx` - Review display with stats and voting

**Database Tables:**
- `reviews` - Main review data with ratings and text
- `review_flags` - Abuse reports on reviews
- `review_votes` - Helpful/not helpful voting
- `profile_review_stats` - Materialized view for performance

---

### 3. **Feature Flag System** üö©

- **Toggle Entire System**: Can enable/disable review system site-wide
- **Cached**: 5-minute in-memory cache for performance
- **Flexible**: Easy to add new feature flags

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/featureFlags.ts` - Feature flag utility with caching

**Database Tables:**
- `feature_flags` - Stores enabled/disabled state for features

## üîß How It Works

### Check-in Flow:
1. **Host** creates event ‚Üí views event page ‚Üí generates QR code
2. **Host** displays QR code at physical event location
3. **Attendee** arrives at event ‚Üí opens event page on phone
4. **Attendee** clicks "Scan QR Code" ‚Üí camera opens
5. **Attendee** scans host's QR code ‚Üí automatic check-in
6. ‚úÖ Check-in recorded, user marked as verified attendee

### Review Flow:
1. **After event**, user can review other attendees
2. Opens review form ‚Üí selects star rating (required)
3. Optionally adds detailed ratings (friendliness, communication, reliability)
4. Writes review text (10-1000 characters, required)
5. Submits ‚Üí review stored with "verified attendee" badge if checked in
6. Review appears on reviewee's profile
7. Community can vote helpful/unhelpful or flag for moderation

## üìù Testing Guide

### Test QR Check-in:
1. Create an event (you'll be the host)
2. Visit your event page
3. You should see "QR –ö–æ–¥ –∑–∞ —Ä–µ–≥–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è" section
4. Click "–°—ä–∑–¥–∞–π QR –∫–æ–¥" ‚Üí "–ü–æ–∫–∞–∂–∏ QR –∫–æ–¥"
5. Take a photo of the QR code with your phone
6. On phone: open the same event page
7. Click "–°–∫–∞–Ω–∏—Ä–∞–π QR –∫–æ–¥"
8. Scan the QR code from your computer screen
9. ‚úÖ Should see "–£—Å–ø–µ—à–Ω–∞ —Ä–µ–≥–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è!"

### Test Reviews:
1. Check in to an event (via QR code)
2. Have another user check in too
3. After event, use ReviewForm component to review the other user
4. Select rating stars, write review text
5. Submit review
6. Visit the other user's profile
7. See your review displayed with "verified attendee" badge

### Test Feature Flags:
```sql
-- Disable review system
UPDATE feature_flags SET is_enabled = false WHERE feature_name = 'review_system';

-- Re-enable review system
UPDATE feature_flags SET is_enabled = true WHERE feature_name = 'review_system';
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### QR Code doesn't appear for hosts:
- Make sure you're logged in
- Verify you're viewing YOUR event (not someone else's)
- Check browser console for errors
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Camera doesn't work:
- **Desktop**: Most desktops don't have cameras - use mobile device
- **Mobile**: Grant camera permissions in browser settings
- Check browser compatibility (Chrome, Safari, Edge recommended)

### Reviews not showing:
- Check feature flag is enabled in database
- Verify review was submitted (check `reviews` table)
- Clear cache and refresh page
- Check browser console for errors
