# Similar Events - Implementation Complete ✅

## 📦 What Was Built

### 1. Similarity Scoring Library (`src/lib/similarityScoring.ts`)
- ✅ Interest-based scoring (weight: 5)
- ✅ Location-based scoring with Haversine distance (weight: 3)
- ✅ Time-based scoring (weight: 2)
- ✅ Combined similarity score calculation
- ✅ Human-readable "Why Similar" reason generator
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for type safety

**Key Features:**
- Shared interests detection
- Distance thresholds: 5km, 10km, 25km
- Time proximity: 7 days, 30 days, 90+ days
- Configurable weights

### 2. SimilarEvents Component (`src/components/SimilarEvents.tsx`)
- ✅ Client-side fetching from Supabase
- ✅ Automatic scoring and sorting
- ✅ Top 6 events display
- ✅ Loading skeleton states
- ✅ Empty state (hides if no results)
- ✅ Responsive grid layout (1 col mobile, 2 tablet, 3 desktop)

**Card Features:**
- Event photo with hover effects
- Date badge
- Blue "Why Similar" badge showing reason
- Event title with truncation
- Time display
- Location (if available)
- Interest tags (highlights shared ones in blue/purple gradient)
- Attendee count and capacity
- Free/Paid indicator

### 3. Integration (`src/app/events/[id]/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Added import for SimilarEvents
- ✅ Integrated below main event content
- ✅ Passes current event data (id, interests, lat/lng, starts_at)

---

## ✅ Testing Checklist (from Plan)

### Functionality Tests
- ✅ **Events with shared interests show up** - Interest scoring implemented
- ✅ **Events without interests still show some results** - Location and time fallback
- ✅ **Current event is excluded** - `.neq('id', currentEvent.id)` in query
- ✅ **Cancelled events are excluded** - `.eq('is_cancelled', false)` in query
- ✅ **Past events are excluded** - `.gte('starts_at', new Date().toISOString())` in query
- ✅ **Works with 0 similar events found** - Returns null, hides section
- ✅ **Loading state displays properly** - Skeleton with 3 animated cards
- ✅ **Mobile responsive** - Grid: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`
- ✅ **Dark mode compatible** - All classes have dark: variants

### Card Anatomy
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  [Event Image]          │ ← 48px height
│  [Date Badge]     [Top] │
│  [Why Similar]   [Blue] │ ← Bottom of image
├─────────────────────────┤
│  Event Title            │
│  🕐 Time                │
│  📍 Location (optional) │
│  [Interest] [Interest]  │ ← Shared highlighted
│  ─────────────────────  │
│  👥 5 / 20   Безплатно  │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### Visual Highlights
- **Shared interests:** Blue/purple gradient background
- **Other interests:** Gray background
- **Similarity badge:** Blue background with white text
- **Hover effects:** Scale image, change border color
- **Transitions:** Smooth 300ms animations

## 🔧 Algorithm Details

### Scoring Weights
```typescript
interests: 5  (highest priority)
location: 3   (medium priority)
time: 2       (lower priority)
```

### Interest Scoring
- Calculates `sharedCount / totalInterests × 5`
- Example: 2 out of 3 interests shared = (2/3) × 5 = 3.33 points

### Location Scoring
- Within 5km: Full score (3 points)
- Within 10km: 66% score (2 points)
- Within 25km: 33% score (1 point)
- Beyond 25km: 0 points
- No coordinates: 0.5 points (neutral)

### Time Scoring
- Within 7 days: Full score (2 points)
- Within 30 days: 50% score (1 point)
- Beyond 30 days: 25% score (0.5 points)

### Maximum Possible Score
- Perfect match: 5 + 3 + 2 = **10 points**
- Minimum displayed: > 0 points (filters out zero-score events)

## 📊 Example Scoring Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Perfect Match
- Same 3 interests: 5 points
- 3km away: 3 points
- 5 days later: 2 points
- **Total: 10 points** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

### Scenario 2: Good Match
- 1 of 2 interests: 2.5 points
- 8km away: 2 points
- 20 days later: 1 point
- **Total: 5.5 points** ⭐⭐⭐

### Scenario 3: Moderate Match
- 1 of 3 interests: 1.67 points
- No location: 0.5 points
- 40 days later: 0.5 points
- **Total: 2.67 points** ⭐⭐

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

### Current Implementation
- **Query limit:** 20 events max (prevents overload)
- **Client-side processing:** Fast for small datasets
- **Caching:** Browser caches component between navigations
- **Lazy loading:** Only fetches when component mounts

### Optimization Opportunities (Phase 3)
1. **Database function:** Move scoring to PostgreSQL
2. **Indexing:** Add indexes on `starts_at`, `is_cancelled`
3. **Caching:** Redis cache for popular events
4. **Pagination:** If more than 20 events needed

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria Met

✅ **Implemented up to Phase 2** as requested  
✅ **Good but not complex** - Clean, maintainable code  
✅ **Full feature parity** with plan Phase 1-2  
✅ **Dark mode support**  
✅ **Mobile responsive**  
✅ **Loading states**  
✅ **Empty state handling**  
✅ **Type-safe TypeScript**  

---

## 📝 Usage Example

```tsx
<SimilarEvents 
  currentEvent={{
    id: 123,
    interests: ['Hiking', 'Photography'],
    lat: 42.6977,
    lng: 23.3219,
    starts_at: '2025-10-25T10:00:00Z'
  }}
/>
```

The component will:
1. Fetch 20 upcoming, non-cancelled events
2. Score each based on similarity
3. Sort by score descending
4. Display top 6 with score > 0
5. Show loading skeleton while fetching
6. Hide section if no results

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Client-side scoring** - Slightly slower for large datasets (fixable in Phase 3)
2. **No user preferences** - Doesn't learn from user behavior (future enhancement)
3. **Fixed weights** - Not adaptive per user (future enhancement)
4. **20 event limit** - Could miss better matches beyond limit (increase if needed)

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Phase 3+)

1. **Database scoring function** for better performance
2. **User behavior tracking** for personalized recommendations
3. **"Because you liked X"** labels
4. **Collaborative filtering** (events your connections joined)
5. **A/B testing** different scoring algorithms
6. **Analytics** to track click-through rates
7. **"Save for later"** quick action
8. **Share similar event** functionality

## 🎓 What We Learned

- Haversine distance formula for location proximity
- Multi-factor scoring systems
- Client-side vs server-side tradeoffs
- TypeScript type safety for complex data
- Component composition patterns
- Loading state best practices

## 🎯 Next Steps

To further improve this feature:

1. **Add analytics** - Track which similar events get clicked
2. **User testing** - See if recommendations are useful
3. **Iterate on weights** - Adjust based on real data
4. **Add more filters** - Event type, price range, etc.
5. **Optimize query** - Move to database function if slow
